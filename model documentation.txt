# Model documentation

As describe in the course, there are two main components for path planning:
- Behavior selection
- Trajectory generation

In general, it is recommended to separate  behavior selection from trajectory generation, both in source and in context (behavior selection is invoked less often than trajectory creation). However, for simplicity in this project, I have only separated the modules but their invocation is done from the same context (message sent from simulator).

Once a message is  received from simulator, DrivingStateMachine is updated with sensor fusion data (and other data needed) and makes a decision about whether it is needed to change  lane and accordingly sets :state, target velocity and target lane. 

After this update, our main message handler runs the sequence to generate smooth trajectory which is sent back to the simulator.

## Behavior selection
